Zantastico X
=============

Zantastico X is a [ZPanelX](http://www.zpanelcp.com/) module which enables users to install a wide range of web applications such as WordPress and Joomla.

It is a complete rewrite of T.Gates, B.Allen, and M.Mirza's version.

It is open source, licensed under GPLv3 or any later version.

### Development Status

Currently this is not a fully functioning module and still requires some polishing.

It is not recommended for use on a production server.

Your welcome to make a pull request to help me out :wink:
